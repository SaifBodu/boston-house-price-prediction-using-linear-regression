<h3><b>Boston House Price Prediction using Linear Regression</b></h3>
<p>This project is a simple implementation of linear regression to predict the prices of houses in Boston. The dataset used in this project is the famous Boston Housing dataset available in the sklearn.datasets library.</p>

<h4><b>Dependencies</h4></b>
<br>The following packages are required to run this project:

<li>numpy
<li>pandas
<li>matplotlib
<li>scikit-learn
<li>Files
<br><br>The project contains the following files:

<p>boston_housing.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: This file.</p>
<br>Usage
<p>To use this project, simply open the boston_housing.ipynb file in Jupyter notebook or Jupyter Lab and run the cells. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each step of the process.</p>

<h4><b><br>Dataset</h4></b>
<p>The Boston Housing dataset contains information about various features of houses in Boston, such as crime rate, number of rooms, proximity to highways, and more. The dataset contains a total of 506 instances and 13 features, and the target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars.<p/>

<br><h4><b>Model</h4></b>
<p>Linear regression is a simple and effective method for predicting continuous variables. In this project, we use the scikit-learn implementation of linear regression to train a model on the Boston Housing dataset. We split the dataset into training and testing sets, fit the model to the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data using the mean squared error metric.</p>

<br><h4><b>Conclusion</h4></b>
<p>This project demonstrates a simple implementation of linear regression for predicting house prices in Boston. By using this model, we can estimate the value of a house based on its features, which can be useful for real estate investors and home buyers.</p>
